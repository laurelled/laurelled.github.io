## About
Welcome to my personal website. My name is Lorenzo Bafunno.

I am a ****recent graduate in computer science**** at the University of Turin. Right now I am focusing on web development, using ****TypeScript**** as my main programming language. My curious nature makes me also interested in a miscellaneous of topics:
- Brain Computer Interfaces (BCIs) and neurotechnologies;
- neural networks, cognitive computing and the Semantic Web;
- computer science fundamentals such as type theory, Î»-calculus and logic.

## About, Further
As I mentioned, I am a curious person. Thus, I usually spend my free time reading research articles about my interests or books that gives me insight on subject I could not study in my academic career, for example Psychology or Neuroscience.
<br/>
<br/>
Recently, I started to make small projects or contribute in Open Source existing ones. You can find my publicly shared works on my [GitHub page](https://github.com/laurelled), although they're not many.

## Languages
I am also interested in learning new languages: my native language is Italian, but I'm learning Spanish and Japanese little by little, and of course English. Sooner or later I will start learning Dutch, as I'll be relocating in the next years in the Netherlands. 

If you know any of these languages and are willing to help me, I would love to have a chat with you!
